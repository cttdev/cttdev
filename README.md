Hi! I'm Claudius, a student at Leland High School in San Jose and the Co-President of *FIRST* Robotics Competition Team 604 Quixilver.

I'm interested in controls engineering, specifically trajectory optimization and nonlinear control.

Here's some stuff I've worked on:
 * [_WPILib_](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib): Worked on a modern controls/state-space library for WPILib in both Java and C++.
 * [_Quikplan_](https://github.com/frc604/quikplan-public): Developed a [time-optimal trajectory generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hyvYzN-jH0) for wheeled, nonholonomic robots in Python.
 * _Robotnik_: Maintained a robot control framework in Java.
